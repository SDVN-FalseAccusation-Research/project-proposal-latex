2.1 Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN)
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) represent a specialized class of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) characterized by high node mobility, rapidly changing network topology, and highly unstable communication environments, supporting various communication patterns including Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}, [3] \cite{cardona2020software}. Traditional VANETs face significant challenges including limited scalability, insufficient flexibility, lack of programmability, and inefficient traffic management, often resulting in network congestion, reduced throughput, and compromised routing efficiency [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}. To address these limitations, Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN) emerged by integrating SDN principles—specifically the separation of the control plane from the data plane—into vehicular networking environments, enabling centralized control, enhanced programmability, and improved traffic management capabilities critical for maintaining network trust and stability [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}, [3] \cite{cardona2020software}. This architectural transformation is particularly significant for implementing reputation-based systems and trust mechanisms, as the centralized SDN controller can maintain global network views and coordinate security policies across distributed vehicular nodes [3] \cite{cardona2020software}.

SDVN architectures comprise critical components including On-Board Units (OBUs) enabling vehicle communications, Road Side Units (RSUs) functioning as infrastructure gateways, Tamper Proof Devices (TPDs) providing secure storage for vehicle credentials and keys, and Trusted Authorities managing authentication and trust relationships [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}. The literature identifies hierarchical SDVN architectures where control planes are divided into upper and lower tiers, with main SDN controllers maintaining global oversight and sub-controllers managing local network segments, facilitating secure traffic flow management between V2V, V2R, and V2I communications [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}, [3] \cite{cardona2020software}. However, this centralized architecture introduces specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited to manipulate network trust and routing decisions, as compromised controllers or RSUs can affect entire network segments under their control [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}. Research demonstrates that while SDVN implementations achieve significant performance improvements—up to 84% reduction in controller overhead and 60% reduction in network bandwidth consumption—the centralized control plane becomes a critical point for security attacks affecting routing efficiency, Quality of Service (QoS), and overall network stability [3] \cite{cardona2020software}.
Despite its advantages, SDVN faces critical security challenges across multiple threat vectors: man-in-the-middle attacks on communication channels, data plane vulnerabilities enabling injection of fake traffic flows, RSU vulnerabilities that allow attackers to cause network disorder through Denial of Service attacks, control plane communication attacks including Distributed Denial of Service that generate excessive controller queries causing service delays, and SDN controller vulnerabilities such as identity spoofing enabling malicious actors to impersonate legitimate controllers and manipulate network operations [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}. These vulnerabilities create opportunities for sophisticated attacks targeting reputation systems and trust mechanisms, where malicious nodes can exploit centralized trust management to falsely accuse legitimate nodes, manipulate routing decisions, and compromise network integrity [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}. Critical research gaps exist in comprehensive defense mechanisms that integrate decentralized verification with advanced technologies to mitigate reputation-based attacks, particularly those involving coordinated malicious behavior, fabricated evidence, and collusion with compromised infrastructure components [1] \cite{adnan2021towards}, [3] \cite{cardona2020software}. While existing research has proposed various security mechanisms for V2V and V2I communications, there remains a significant gap in integrated approaches that combine tamper-proof reputation logging, privacy-preserving verification, and intelligent anomaly detection to robustly address false accusation attacks that manipulate trust systems, eliminate legitimate routes, degrade QoS, and destabilize control-plane operations in dynamic SDVN environments.
2.2 False Accusation Attacks in Vehicular Networks
False accusation attacks represent a critical threat in vehicular networks where malicious nodes fabricate false alert messages accusing normal nodes as misbehaving nodes, causing rapid network performance degradation [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Simulation results demonstrate that false accusation attacks produce faster throughput reduction over time compared to selfish nodes, affecting network performance more dramatically as false accusation nodes can exclude legitimate participants from routing processes, thereby degrading overall network efficiency and survivability [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. In reputation-based intrusion detection systems operating in distributed and cooperative network structures, approaches that detect abnormal activities based on individual node-created reputations are inherently vulnerable to false accusations, particularly when nodes conspire together to signify normal nodes as intruders or when compromised nodes report wrong reputation scores to neighboring nodes [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. The fundamental attack mechanism involves malicious nodes on communication paths falsely reporting that normal nodes failed to deliver data to destination nodes, although these accused nodes actually forwarded packets correctly; when source nodes fail to receive acknowledgment messages within certain timeframes due to malicious nodes discarding them, they mistakenly identify normal nodes as abnormal based on false reports, leading to legitimate node exclusion from the network [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Existing research identifies critical limitations where most studies do not consider comprehensive response methods for false accusations, and intelligent attackers performing abnormal activities while maintaining misbehaviors below predefined thresholds evade detection, allowing attacks to continue undetected [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Vehicular networks face diverse attack variants including false alert generation attacks, position falsification attacks using GPS spoofing techniques or Sybil attacks, and trust-distortion attacks that manipulate trust management mechanisms tricking nodes into accepting inaccurate reliability estimates [6] \cite{che2022trust}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}.
The consequences of false accusation attacks severely impact network functionality through multiple mechanisms including false path elimination where legitimate nodes are blacklisted removing valid routes, route concentration toward attacker-controlled nodes compromising routing integrity, Quality of Service degradation with increased packet loss and delays, and control-plane instability from frequent trust score fluctuations [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Experimental evidence confirms that while cryptographic methods provide protection against external attacks, they remain vulnerable to internal attacks where authenticated vehicles execute malicious behavior; protocols like CONFIDANT that detect abnormal activities without considering false accusations show initial performance improvements but experience rapid performance degradation as normal nodes are excluded due to malicious false accusations over time, demonstrating fatal vulnerabilities despite capability in detecting simple abnormal activities [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Critical research gaps persist in comprehensive defense mechanisms integrating decentralized verification, tamper-proof evidence logging, privacy-preserving accusation verification, and intelligent anomaly detection to robustly mitigate sophisticated false accusation attack patterns including single-accuser opportunistic fabrications, Sybil-amplified consensus flooding, timing-based accusations during high-noise periods, evidence-spoofing with tampered logs, and collusion with compromised infrastructure components in dynamic vehicular network environments that compromise network trust, routing efficiency, and overall stability [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}.

2.3 Blockchain Technology in Vehicular Networks
Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for addressing trust management challenges in vehicular networks due to its significant characteristics including consistency, fault tolerance, decentralization, and tamper-proof properties [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}. Blockchain serves as an immutable distributed ledger where vehicular communication data, trust evaluations, and reputation information can be verified and traced publicly, with the consensus mechanism contributing to establishing trust among vehicles while overcoming performance bottlenecks associated with centralized trust management systems [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}. The decentralized nature of blockchain addresses critical limitations in traditional vehicular networks, particularly the difficulty of establishing trusted central servers to save and update historical trust information of all vehicles in real-time across wide geographic scopes with high mobility, while ensuring recorded trust information maintains data consistency and tamper-resistant properties [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}. Various blockchain architectures for vehicular networks have been proposed, including systems maintaining multiple blockchains such as certificate blockchains (CerBC) for vehicle identity verification and request blockchains (ReqBC) for recording location-based service queries and cooperation requests, enabling Registration Authorities to manage vehicle certificates, track malicious vehicles, and initiate dispute arbitration when behaviors cannot be determined as malicious [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}.
Research demonstrates that blockchain-based trust management schemes for vehicular networks adopt different architectural approaches addressing specific security and performance challenges [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}. Decentralized blockchain-based frameworks compute global trust metrics for each vehicle stored in immutable ledgers, typically operating through three phases: trust metrics evaluation where vehicles assess authenticity of received messages and calculate local trust metrics for originator vehicles, trust metrics aggregation where miners collect and aggregate received trust metrics to compute aggregated values, and blocks generation and validation where aggregated trust metrics are packed into blocks and added to the blockchain after solving consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}. However, existing blockchain schemes exhibit limitations including trust evaluation relying solely on geographic position proximity to events which is insufficient for determining credibility as malicious vehicles near events can generate false messages, underutilization of blockchain capabilities with excessive network structure complexity, and dependence on centralized authorities like Law Enforcement Agencies for recording public key-identity pairs leading to scalability challenges [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}. Some approaches assign trust metric assessment to RSUs causing delays in global trust metrics convergence and sharing, while others lack clear explanation of trust metrics calculation processes and factors considered for assessing vehicle trustworthiness [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}.
Blockchain integration with vehicular networks enables enhanced security capabilities including distributed reputation management, anonymous authentication, and collaborative intrusion detection [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}. The tamper-proof nature of blockchain allows secure storage of reputation scores, certificate management including registration, updating, and revocation, and provides proof of certificate existence with capabilities for tracking malicious vehicles through dispute arbitration mechanisms [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}. Recent developments propose deep learning-driven blockchain-based trust management systems combining physical unclonable function-based identity authentication, Bayesian-based message reliability computation, and optimized consensus mechanisms adapted for vehicular mobility, offering multi-faceted trust management architectures that enhance trust evaluation fidelity and detection of nuanced attack types [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}. However, critical research gaps remain in developing comprehensive blockchain frameworks that effectively integrate tamper-proof reputation logging with privacy-preserving verification mechanisms, intelligent anomaly detection for identifying coordinated malicious behaviors including false accusation attacks, and efficient consensus protocols suitable for highly dynamic vehicular environments with frequent topology changes, particularly for mitigating sophisticated attacks involving fabricated evidence, Sybil-amplified consensus flooding, and collusion with compromised infrastructure components while maintaining real-time performance requirements for safety-critical applications [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}, [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}.

2.4 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) 
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique enabling one party (the prover) to demonstrate the validity of a statement to another party (the verifier) without revealing any additional information beyond the proof's validity [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. ZKPs play a crucial role in enhancing privacy and security in vehicular networks by allowing vehicles to prove attributes such as identity credentials, authorization, or specific information possession without disclosing sensitive data that could compromise privacy [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. Two main categories of ZKP technology exist: Interactive ZKP (Inter-ZKP) where the prover and verifier engage in iterative exchange protocols to establish statement validity without disclosing sensitive information, and Non-Interactive ZKP where the prover can authenticate information without requiring back-and-forth communication with the verifier [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. Advanced ZKP implementations including Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) have emerged offering compact proofs independent of computation size, strong privacy guarantees, post-quantum security resistance, and efficient verification capabilities particularly valuable for blockchain and cryptocurrency applications [14] \cite{lavin2024survey}, [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. In vehicular data sharing systems, zk-SNARKs protect privacy during authentication procedures by enabling vehicles to prove identity attributes or credential ownership without revealing underlying sensitive information, with research demonstrating their effectiveness in concealing registration and attribute information while maintaining secure authentication processes [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}, [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}. Applications of ZKP in vehicular networks address critical privacy challenges including identity authentication, location privacy preservation, and secure credential verification without trusted intermediaries, with zero-knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) enabling validation of vehicle locations without revealing precise coordinates and self-blindable signature schemes enabling anonymous key exchange protocols where vehicles compute anonymous shared keys based on zero-knowledge proof of knowledge, achieving secure authentication, forward unlinkability, and accountability without requiring interference from Roadside Units or Certificate Authorities [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}, [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}, [17] \cite{almarshoud2022location}.
Despite significant advantages, ZKP-enabled systems face challenges including scalability concerns as blockchain networks grow, computational overhead for proof generation particularly in resource-constrained vehicular environments, complexity requiring cryptographic expertise for implementation and validation, trusted setup requirements in some implementations that could be compromised, and performance overhead that may not be justified for small computations [14] \cite{lavin2024survey}, [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. Adaptive zero-knowledge authentication protocols in VANETs provide high imitation resistance without using symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, reducing time spent on authentication by decreasing the number of modular exponentiation operations and reducing the number of responses while calculating true and falsified digests of the prover and verifying response correctness [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}. Critical research gaps persist in developing efficient ZKP mechanisms specifically optimized for highly dynamic vehicular environments with frequent topology changes, integrating ZKP with decentralized verification systems for validating accusation authenticity in reputation-based trust management, combining ZKP with blockchain for tamper-proof evidence logging while maintaining real-time performance requirements for safety-critical applications, and addressing emerging threats and attack vectors as ZKP-enabled systems become more prevalent in vehicular networks [14] \cite{lavin2024survey}, [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}. Furthermore, limited research exists on utilizing ZKP for privacy-preserving verification of node behavior and accusation authenticity in defense mechanisms against sophisticated false accusation attack patterns including evidence-spoofing with tampered logs, Sybil-amplified consensus flooding, and collusion with compromised infrastructure components, particularly in scenarios requiring verifiable proofs without revealing sensitive vehicle operational data or communication patterns that could be exploited by adversaries in dynamic SDVN environments [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}, [17] \cite{almarshoud2022location}.


2.5 Artificial Intelligence in Vehicular Networks
Machine learning and deep learning techniques have emerged as critical tools for detecting sophisticated attacks in vehicular networks, particularly for identifying anomalous patterns in reputation systems and trust management schemes vulnerable to false accusation attacks [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}, [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a breakthrough technology for analyzing complex network structures in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN), leveraging message passing mechanisms that aggregate information from neighboring nodes to understand relational patterns and identify anomalous accusation clusters that deviate from normal network behavior [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. Self-supervised GNN-based approaches such as GraphSAGE and Anomal-E have demonstrated superior performance in network intrusion detection by analyzing network topology and edge features, with GraphSAGE introducing inductive learning capabilities through neighbor sampling mechanisms that enable efficient processing of dynamic vehicular network scenarios where topology changes frequently due to vehicle mobility [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. Research demonstrates GNN-based models achieving macro F1 scores exceeding 93% in anomaly detection tasks by enriching network flow data with relevant features and representing traffic as graphs, allowing GNNs to learn complex relationships between nodes and detect coordinated malicious behaviors including Sybil attacks, collusive tampering, and reputation manipulation attempts where multiple nodes conspire to fabricate false accusations against legitimate participants [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}, [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. Deep learning approaches incorporating attention mechanisms and adversarial training have shown effectiveness in adapting to sophisticated attack patterns, with federated learning frameworks enabling privacy-preserving model training across distributed vehicular nodes without requiring centralized data collection, addressing scalability concerns in large-scale SDVN deployments [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}.
Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4, BERT-based architectures, and transformer models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in cybersecurity applications through advanced contextual understanding and natural language processing of heterogeneous security data including system logs, network flows, and threat reports [21, 22]. The integration of GNN-LLM frameworks represents a promising approach for comprehensive defense against false accusation attacks in vehicular networks, where GNNs analyze network topology to identify anomalous accusation patterns and structural relationships while LLMs process graph-derived insights combined with natural language logs for contextual threat assessment, automated response generation, and interpretation of complex attack scenarios involving fabricated evidence and tampered communication records [18, 19, 21, 22]. Transformer-based architectures capture temporal and structural relationships in dynamic network environments, enabling detection of timing-based accusations during high-noise periods and evidence-spoofing attacks where attackers fabricate traceroute-like evidence to appear authentic [21]. BERT-based models fine-tuned for security applications have shown effectiveness in parsing and classifying security-relevant textual data, with potential applications in analyzing accusation messages, verifying claim authenticity, and identifying linguistic patterns associated with malicious false reporting in reputation systems [22]. However, critical challenges persist including scalability concerns for real-time processing in resource-constrained vehicular environments, computational overhead of combined GNN-LLM architectures, bias in training data leading to under-representation of novel false accusation attack variants, and requirements for extensive validation in dynamic SDVN scenarios with frequent topology changes and high mobility [18, 19, 21]. Critical research gaps exist in developing integrated GNN-LLM frameworks that combine network topology analysis with contextual threat interpretation for detecting sophisticated false accusation attacks involving single-accuser opportunistic fabrications, Sybil-amplified consensus flooding, collusion with compromised infrastructure components, and coordinated reputation manipulation, while maintaining real-time performance requirements, privacy preservation, and ensuring verifiable trust mechanisms in distributed vehicular network architectures prioritizing routing efficiency and QoS stability [18, 19, 21, 22].



Gaps in Literature
3.1 Limited Integration of Advanced Technologies
Existing research in vehicular network security predominantly focuses on single-technology solutions that address isolated aspects of false accusation attack mitigation. Blockchain-based approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in providing tamper-proof reputation logging and distributed consensus mechanisms for trust management, with several studies implementing decentralized trust evaluation systems where RSUs or miners aggregate trust metrics received from vehicles and store them in immutable ledgers [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}, [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}. However, these blockchain-centric solutions often lack sophisticated attack detection mechanisms beyond basic reputation score tracking and threshold-based anomaly identification. Similarly, reputation-based intrusion detection systems have been extensively studied, with approaches utilizing node weight management, compensation algorithms, and ElGamal cryptography to address false accusations through detection algorithms that identify malicious reporting patterns [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Machine learning-based misbehavior detection systems, including those employing Dempster-Shafer theory for collaborative detection and beta distribution-based reputation updates, have shown improved accuracy in identifying malicious vehicles but operate independently without integration with decentralized verification mechanisms [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Zero-knowledge proof applications in vehicular networks have primarily focused on privacy-preserving authentication and anonymous credential systems, with implementations using zk-SNARKs for identity protection during authentication procedures, yet these remain disconnected from comprehensive reputation management and attack detection frameworks [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}, [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}, [17] \cite{almarshoud2022location}.
The critical gap lies in the absence of comprehensive frameworks that synergistically combine blockchain for tamper-proof evidence logging and distributed validation, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verification of node behavior and accusation authenticity, and advanced AI techniques including Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models for intelligent anomaly detection and contextual threat interpretation. While individual technologies have matured independently, no existing work presents a unified multi-layered security architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of blockchain's immutability, ZKP's privacy preservation, GNN's topology analysis capabilities, and LLM's contextual understanding to create a holistic defense against sophisticated false accusation attacks in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks. This fragmentation prevents the development of robust systems capable of simultaneously ensuring verifiable trust through cryptographic proofs, maintaining privacy of sensitive vehicular data, detecting complex coordinated attack patterns through network topology analysis, and interpreting multi-source evidence through natural language processing, ultimately leaving SDVN environments vulnerable to advanced false accusation attack variants that exploit the limitations of isolated single-technology defenses.
3.2 Privacy vs. Verification Trade-off
Current reputation-based trust management systems in vehicular networks face a fundamental tension between the need for transparent verification of accusations and the imperative to protect sensitive vehicular data from exposure. Existing approaches typically require nodes to reveal detailed behavioral information including packet forwarding records, communication logs, routing decisions, and network interaction histories to enable verification of misbehavior reports and calculation of trust scores [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}, [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}. Blockchain-based trust evaluation frameworks aggregate trust metrics by having vehicles share local trust assessments with RSUs or miners, who then compute global trust values and store them in distributed ledgers, inherently exposing vehicle behavior patterns and reputation judgments to infrastructure components and potentially to other network participants [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}, [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}. Collaborative misbehavior detection systems employing techniques like Dempster-Shafer theory require vehicles to exchange reputation scores and feedback about suspected malicious nodes, creating privacy risks where vehicular communication patterns, mobility behaviors, and social trust relationships become visible to observers who could infer sensitive information about vehicle routes, destinations, and driver identities [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Traditional cryptographic authentication schemes using Public Key Infrastructure enable identity verification but do not address the privacy concerns inherent in reputation systems where the content of accusations, evidence supporting misbehavior claims, and historical behavior records must be evaluated for authenticity, forcing a choice between transparency for verification and confidentiality of operational data [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}, [17] \cite{almarshoud2022location}.
The research gap centers on insufficient integration of privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, particularly Zero-Knowledge Proofs, into reputation management and false accusation detection systems for vehicular networks. While ZKP applications in VANETs have demonstrated effectiveness in privacy-preserving authentication, anonymous credential verification, and location privacy protection through techniques like zero-knowledge range proofs and self-blindable signatures [15] \cite{zhou2024leveraging}, [16] \cite{kalmykov2022using}, [17] \cite{almarshoud2022location}, these implementations have not been extended to enable verification of accusation authenticity and node behavior validation without revealing the underlying sensitive data. Existing systems lack mechanisms to generate verifiable proofs that demonstrate: (1) an accused node actually forwarded packets correctly without disclosing packet contents or routing paths, (2) an accuser possesses legitimate evidence of misbehavior without exposing complete communication logs or network topology information, (3) behavioral patterns match expected legitimate operation without revealing precise locations, velocities, or destinations, and (4) reputation scores were calculated correctly without exposing individual trust assessments or social network relationships. This gap leaves SDVN environments unable to resolve false accusation attacks while simultaneously preserving privacy of vehicular operational data including location traces, communication patterns, routing decisions, and trust relationships, ultimately forcing system designers to compromise either security through reduced verification rigor or privacy through excessive data exposure, neither of which is acceptable for safety-critical intelligent transportation applications where both verifiable trust and data confidentiality are paramount requirements.
3.3 Incomplete Detection of Sophisticated Attack Variants
Existing defense mechanisms for reputation-based trust management in vehicular networks demonstrate capability in detecting basic misbehavior patterns such as simple packet dropping, straightforward false reporting by individual malicious nodes, and rudimentary reputation manipulation where single attackers provide consistently incorrect trust assessments [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Reputation-based intrusion detection techniques employing node weight management and suspicious node lists can identify nodes that repeatedly make false accusations, using mechanisms like NWMS (Node Weight Management Server) to track accusation accuracy and exclude nodes whose accusations are frequently proven false through cross-verification with destination nodes [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Collaborative misbehavior detection systems applying machine learning classifiers and Dempster-Shafer theory achieve improved detection accuracy by combining multiple observers' assessments and using reputation scores as belief values for feedback aggregation, enabling identification of vehicles broadcasting false alerts or position falsification attacks [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. However, these approaches rely primarily on statistical anomaly detection, threshold-based filtering, and historical pattern matching that assume malicious behaviors exhibit consistent detectable signatures across time, making them effective against unsophisticated attacks but vulnerable to intelligent adversaries who carefully craft attack strategies to evade detection mechanisms.
Critical gaps exist in detecting and mitigating sophisticated false accusation attack variants that exploit weaknesses in current defense systems. Sybil-amplified consensus flooding attacks, where adversaries create multiple fake identities to generate artificial consensus supporting false accusations and overwhelm reputation systems with coordinated malicious reports, remain largely unaddressed as existing blockchain-based trust management systems lack robust Sybil resistance mechanisms and cannot effectively distinguish between legitimate consensus from multiple independent observers versus fabricated agreement from colluding Sybil nodes [6] \cite{che2022trust}, [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}, [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}. Timing-based accusations during high-noise periods exploit temporal vulnerabilities by launching false accusation campaigns when network conditions naturally produce high packet loss, communication failures, or routing disruptions, allowing malicious accusations to blend with legitimate error reports and evade detection systems that cannot differentiate between actual misbehavior and network-induced failures under challenging conditions [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}. Evidence-spoofing attacks involving tampered logs, fabricated traceroute-like data, and manipulated packet forwarding records present verification challenges that current systems cannot address since they lack cryptographic integrity protection for behavioral evidence and cannot validate that submitted proof of misbehavior is authentic rather than artificially constructed by sophisticated attackers [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Collusion attacks involving compromised Roadside Units, controllers, or groups of malicious vehicles coordinating their accusations represent the most dangerous variant, as existing distributed trust evaluation systems assume infrastructure honesty and cannot detect scenarios where RSUs deliberately validate false accusations, controllers manipulate routing decisions based on fabricated reputation data, or coordinated vehicle groups strategically time their false reports to maximize damage against targeted legitimate participants [7] \cite{lee2012efficient}, [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}. These sophisticated attack variants remain insufficiently addressed in current literature, leaving SDVN environments vulnerable to coordinated, intelligent false accusation campaigns that can systematically eliminate legitimate nodes, concentrate routing toward attacker-controlled paths, degrade Quality of Service through strategic blacklisting, and destabilize control-plane trust management through carefully orchestrated reputation manipulation.
3.4 Lack of Context-Aware Threat Intelligence
Traditional machine learning approaches applied to misbehavior detection and intrusion prevention in vehicular networks predominantly utilize classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks that process feature vectors extracted from individual node behaviors, packet characteristics, and temporal sequences [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}, [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. These methods excel at identifying anomalous patterns in isolated data instances by learning statistical distributions of normal versus malicious behaviors, achieving high accuracy in binary or multi-class classification tasks that distinguish between attack types based on pre-defined feature sets [8] \cite{gyawali2020machine}, [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. However, Convolutional Neural Networks designed for grid-structured data like images and time-series cannot effectively capture the complex relational dependencies and graph-structured interactions inherent in vehicular network topologies where trust relationships, communication patterns, and accusation flows form intricate networks of interdependencies between vehicles, RSUs, and controllers [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM architectures, while capable of modeling temporal sequences, similarly fail to represent the spatial graph structure of vehicular networks and cannot leverage topological features such as node centrality, community structures, accusation propagation paths, and structural anomalies that indicate coordinated false accusation campaigns [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}, [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. Existing blockchain-based trust management systems aggregate reputation scores arithmetically without considering the network context of who is accusing whom, the structural positions of accusers and accused within the vehicular network graph, or the patterns of accusation flows that could reveal coordinated attacks [9] \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, [11] \cite{chang2025blockchain}, [12] \cite{li2020blockchain}.
The research gap manifests in two critical dimensions requiring fundamentally different analytical approaches. First, limited application of Graph Neural Networks to model vehicular network topologies as graphs where nodes represent vehicles and edges represent communication links, trust relationships, or accusation flows, preventing systems from detecting structural anomalies such as sudden accusation clustering around specific nodes, unusual propagation patterns of false reports through the network, or coordinated attack signatures where multiple accusers with similar network positions simultaneously target legitimate vehicles [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. GNNs' message-passing mechanisms that aggregate neighborhood information could identify anomalous accusation clusters by analyzing whether accusation patterns deviate from expected network behavior, detecting Sybil attacks through structural analysis of whether multiple accusers exhibit suspiciously similar connectivity patterns, and recognizing collusion by identifying communities of nodes that consistently coordinate their accusations, yet these capabilities remain unexploited in vehicular false accusation detection research [18] \cite{zoubir2024integrating}, [19] \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. Second, complete absence of Large Language Model-based contextual analysis for interpreting complex multi-source evidence including natural language logs, structured accusation messages, behavioral descriptions, and heterogeneous data from network monitoring, preventing systems from performing sophisticated reasoning about accusation authenticity, evidence consistency, and threat context [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}, [22] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. LLMs' advanced natural language understanding could enable analysis of accusation message semantics to detect linguistically suspicious patterns in false reports, cross-referencing of textual evidence with behavioral data to identify inconsistencies suggesting fabrication, interpretation of system logs to contextualize whether reported misbehavior aligns with observed network conditions, and generation of human-interpretable explanations for detection decisions to support incident response, yet no existing work leverages these capabilities for false accusation defense [21] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}, [22] \cite{belcastro2025enhancing}. This dual gap—absence of GNN-based network topology analysis combined with lack of LLM-driven contextual evidence interpretation—leaves SDVN environments without intelligent threat assessment capabilities necessary to detect sophisticated coordinated false accusation attacks that manifest through both structural network patterns and subtle contextual inconsistencies in accusation evidence.

3. Research Gaps
3.1 Limited Integration of Advanced Technologies
Existing research in vehicular network security predominantly focuses on single-technology solutions addressing isolated aspects of false accusation attack mitigation, with blockchain-based approaches providing tamper-proof reputation logging, machine learning systems detecting misbehavior patterns, and zero-knowledge proof applications enabling privacy-preserving authentication, yet operating independently without integration. The critical gap lies in the absence of comprehensive frameworks that synergistically combine blockchain for secure immutable reputation logging and distributed validation, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verification of node behavior and accusation authenticity without revealing sensitive vehicular data, and advanced AI techniques including Graph Neural Networks for analyzing network topology to detect anomalous accusation clusters and Large Language Models for processing graph-derived insights and natural language logs to provide contextual threat assessment and automated response generation. This fragmentation prevents development of robust multi-layered security architectures capable of simultaneously ensuring verifiable trust through cryptographic proofs, maintaining privacy of sensitive data, detecting complex coordinated attack patterns through network topology analysis, and interpreting multi-source evidence through intelligent contextual reasoning, ultimately leaving Software-Defined Vehicular Networks vulnerable to sophisticated false accusation attack variants including single-accuser opportunistic fabrications, Sybil-amplified consensus flooding, timing-based accusations during high-noise periods, evidence-spoofing with tampered logs, and collusion with compromised Roadside Units or controllers that exploit limitations of isolated single-technology defenses.
3.2 Privacy vs. Verification Trade-off
Current reputation-based trust management systems in vehicular networks face fundamental tension between transparent verification of accusations and protection of sensitive vehicular data, with existing approaches requiring nodes to reveal detailed behavioral information including packet forwarding records, communication logs, routing decisions, and network interaction histories to enable verification of misbehavior reports and calculation of trust scores, inherently exposing vehicle behavior patterns to infrastructure components and network participants. The research gap centers on insufficient integration of privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, particularly Zero-Knowledge Proofs, into reputation management and false accusation detection systems, where existing ZKP applications in vehicular networks focus on authentication and credential verification but have not been extended to enable verification of accusation authenticity and node behavior validation without revealing underlying sensitive data. This gap leaves Software-Defined Vehicular Networks unable to generate verifiable proofs demonstrating that accused nodes forwarded packets correctly without disclosing packet contents or routing paths, that accusers possess legitimate evidence without exposing complete communication logs, that behavioral patterns match expected legitimate operation without revealing precise locations and destinations, and that reputation scores were calculated correctly without exposing individual trust assessments, ultimately forcing system designers to compromise either security through reduced verification rigor or privacy through excessive data exposure in safety-critical intelligent transportation applications requiring both verifiable trust mechanisms and data confidentiality as paramount requirements for protecting vehicular operational data including location traces, communication patterns, and routing decisions from malicious inference.
3.3 Incomplete Detection of Sophisticated Attack Variants
Existing defense mechanisms for reputation-based trust management in vehicular networks demonstrate capability in detecting basic misbehavior patterns such as simple packet dropping and straightforward false reporting by individual malicious nodes through statistical anomaly detection, threshold-based filtering, and historical pattern matching, making them effective against unsophisticated attacks but vulnerable to intelligent adversaries who carefully craft evasion strategies. Critical gaps exist in detecting and mitigating sophisticated false accusation attack variants including Sybil-amplified consensus flooding where adversaries create multiple fake identities generating artificial consensus supporting false accusations that overwhelm reputation systems with coordinated malicious reports, timing-based accusations during high-noise periods that exploit temporal vulnerabilities by launching campaigns when network conditions naturally produce high packet loss allowing malicious accusations to blend with legitimate error reports, evidence-spoofing attacks involving tampered logs and fabricated traceroute-like data that present verification challenges since current systems lack cryptographic integrity protection for behavioral evidence, and collusion attacks involving compromised Roadside Units, controllers, or coordinated vehicle groups that assume infrastructure honesty and cannot detect scenarios where infrastructure deliberately validates false accusations or vehicles strategically time false reports to maximize damage against targeted legitimate participants. These sophisticated attack variants remain insufficiently addressed in current literature, leaving Software-Defined Vehicular Networks vulnerable to coordinated intelligent false accusation campaigns that systematically eliminate legitimate nodes through false path elimination and blacklisting, concentrate routing toward attacker-controlled nodes, degrade Quality of Service through increased packet loss and delays, and destabilize control-plane trust management through frequent trust score fluctuations resulting from carefully orchestrated reputation manipulation compromising network trust, routing efficiency, and overall stability.
3.4 Lack of Context-Aware Threat Intelligence
Traditional machine learning approaches applied to misbehavior detection in vehicular networks predominantly utilize classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks that process feature vectors from individual node behaviors achieving high accuracy in classification tasks, but these architectures designed for grid-structured data and temporal sequences cannot effectively capture complex relational dependencies and graph-structured interactions inherent in vehicular network topologies where trust relationships, communication patterns, and accusation flows form intricate networks of interdependencies between vehicles, RSUs, and controllers. The research gap manifests in two critical dimensions: first, limited application of Graph Neural Networks to model vehicular network topologies as graphs where nodes represent vehicles and edges represent communication links, trust relationships, or accusation flows, preventing detection of structural anomalies such as sudden accusation clustering around specific nodes, unusual propagation patterns of false reports, or coordinated attack signatures where multiple accusers with similar network positions simultaneously target legitimate vehicles, as GNNs' message-passing mechanisms aggregating neighborhood information could identify anomalous accusation clusters by analyzing whether patterns deviate from expected network behavior, detecting Sybil attacks through structural analysis of suspiciously similar connectivity patterns, and recognizing collusion by identifying communities coordinating accusations; second, complete absence of Large Language Model-based contextual analysis for interpreting complex multi-source evidence including natural language logs, structured accusation messages, behavioral descriptions, and heterogeneous monitoring data, preventing sophisticated reasoning about accusation authenticity, evidence consistency, and threat context, as LLMs' advanced natural language understanding could enable analysis of accusation message semantics detecting linguistically suspicious patterns, cross-referencing textual evidence with behavioral data identifying inconsistencies suggesting fabrication, interpreting system logs contextualizing whether reported misbehavior aligns with observed network conditions, and generating human-interpretable explanations for detection decisions supporting automated response generation and incident response. This dual gap—absence of GNN-based network topology analysis combined with lack of LLM-driven contextual evidence interpretation—leaves Software-Defined Vehicular Networks without intelligent threat assessment capabilities necessary to detect sophisticated coordinated false accusation attacks manifesting through both structural network patterns and subtle contextual inconsistencies in accusation evidence, failing to provide the contextual threat assessment and automated response generation required for preempting and neutralizing attacks while minimizing impacts on routing and Quality of Service in dynamic vehicular settings prioritizing verifiable trust, anomaly detection, and privacy.
