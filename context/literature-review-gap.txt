3.1 Limited Integration of Blockchain with AI for Trust Management in SDVN
Current studies focus on either blockchain-based trust management or AI-based intrusion detection in vehicular networks independently Blockchain approaches provide tamper-proof reputation logging and distributed consensus \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, while machine learning methods detect anomalous behaviors through pattern recognition \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}. However, existing frameworks fail to synergistically combine blockchain's immutability with AI's intelligent analysis capabilities for comprehensive false accusation attack mitigation .Most research lacks mechanisms where Graph Neural Networks analyze network topology to detect coordinated attack patterns \cite{zoubir2024integrating} while Large Language Models interpret contextual evidence from system logs, with results securely stored on blockchain for verifiable trust Furthermore, current solutions do not address how weighted endorser trust mechanisms can be enhanced through AI-driven behavioral analysis to distinguish legitimate accusations from malicious fabrications \cite{che2022trust}. There is a critical need to develop integrated frameworks that leverage blockchain for decentralized reputation managementGNN for structural anomaly detection in accusation patternsand LLM for semantic reasoning of attack evidence, creating multi-layered defense systems capable of detecting sophisticated false accusation variants including Sybil-amplified consensus flooding \cite{jaballah1904software} and timing-based accusations during high-noise periods in dynamic SDVN environments 

3.2 Insufficient Privacy-Preserving Verification Mechanisms for Reputation Systems
Current reputation-based trust management systems in SDVN require nodes to reveal detailed behavioral information including packet forwarding records, communication logs, and routing decisions to enable verification of misbehavior accusations \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}. While Zero-Knowledge Proof applications exist for authentication and credential verification in vehicular networks \cite{lavin2024survey}, these implementations have not been extended to reputation systems for validating accusation authenticity without exposing sensitive data \cite{kalmykov2022using}. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to generate verifiable proofs demonstrating that accused nodes forwarded packets correctly without disclosing routing paths, that accusers possess legitimate evidence without revealing complete communication logs, or that reputation scores were calculated correctly without exposing individual trust assessments \cite{kalmykov2022using}. This forces system designers to compromise either security through reduced verification rigor or privacy through excessive data exposure. There is a critical need to integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs with blockchain-based reputation management \cite{lavin2024survey} to enable privacy-preserving verification of node behavior and accusation authenticity, allowing vehicles to prove compliance with expected operation without revealing precise locations, velocities, destinations, or communication patterns that could be exploited by adversaries in sophisticated false accusation attacks .

3.3 Lack of Intelligent Detection for Coordinated False Accusation Attacks
Current misbehavior detection systems in SDVN rely on statistical anomaly detection, threshold-based filtering, and historical pattern matching that effectively identify simple packet dropping or individual false reporting but fail against sophisticated coordinated attacks \cite{gyawali2020machine}. Traditional machine learning approaches using CNNs and RNNs process feature vectors from individual node behaviors but cannot capture complex relational dependencies in vehicular network topologies where trust relationships and accusation flows form intricate interdependencies \cite{chang2025blockchain}. Existing solutions lack capability to detect Sybil-amplified consensus flooding where multiple fake identities create artificial consensus , timing-based accusations that exploit network congestion periods to mask malicious reports or collusion involving compromised RSUs and controllers coordinating false accusations \cite{ahmed2022privacy}. Graph Neural Networks remain underutilized for modeling vehicular networks as graphs to identify structural anomalies such as star-topology accusation patterns, suspicious clustering, or coordinated communities targeting legitimate vehicles. There is urgent need to develop GNN-based frameworks that leverage message-passing mechanisms to analyze network topology \cite{chattopadhyay2024gnn}, detect anomalous accusation clusters, and identify coordinated attack signatures, combined with temporal attention mechanisms to distinguish genuine network failures from malicious timing-based accusations during high-noise periods.

3.4 Insufficient Immutable Evidence Logging and Historical Verification

Current vehicular network security frameworks lack comprehensive mechanisms for establishing immutable chain-of-custody for accusation evidence, enabling attackers to fabricate or tamper with packet logs, routing traces, and sensor data without detection \cite{chang2025blockchain}. Existing systems do not maintain cryptographically verifiable timestamps proving when behavioral evidence was captured and recorded ,allowing sophisticated attackers to retrospectively manufacture fake evidence matching historical network events to frame honest nodes \cite{ahmed2022privacy}. Most approaches lack blockchain-based evidence integrity protection where original packet hashes are stored immutably at capture time \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, preventing backdating of fabricated accusations or manipulation of evidence post-incident. Furthermore, current solutions do not provide comprehensive forensic audit trails tracking complete accusation lifecycles including who accused whom, what evidence was submitted, how endorsers voted, and final reputation score changes with cryptographic non-repudiation ,hindering post-incident investigation and accountability. Reputation management systems typically lack mechanisms to identify and gradually reduce trust weights of nodes that frequently make false accusations through historical pattern analysis \cite{gazdar2022decentralized}, allowing malicious nodes to continue disruption despite repeated invalid accusations. There is critical need to develop blockchain-based evidence management frameworks maintaining immutable chain-of-custody with traceable cryptographic hashes unfalsifiable timestamps within acceptable time windows \cite{ahmed2022privacy}, comprehensive audit logs enabling forensic analysis of accusation patterns ,and automated trust weight reduction mechanisms for nodes exhibiting consistent false reporting behaviors in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks .
