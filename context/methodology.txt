1 Methodology
1.1 Research Design
This research proposes a blockchain-based security framework integrated with artificial intelligence to mitigate False Accusation Attacks in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN). The framework operates on a Zero-Trust Architecture principle, where no network entity—vehicles, roadside units, or controllers—is trusted by default [1] \cite{rose2020zero}. Instead, continuous verification and validation mechanisms ensure that only legitimate nodes participate in routing decisions.
The methodology addresses four distinct attack variants that exploit reputation management systems in SDVN: (1) single-accuser fabrications where privileged nodes falsely accuse legitimate vehicles, (2) Sybil-amplified attacks where multiple fake identities create artificial consensus, (3) timing-based accusations that exploit network congestion periods, and (4) evidence-spoofing through tampered logs [2] \cite{khan2017topology} [3] \cite{arif2020sdn}. Each variant requires specialized detection and mitigation strategies integrated into a cohesive defense framework.
1.2 Threat Model
The adversary model adopts a Zero-Trust Architecture where any network component may potentially be compromised. The threat model defines attacker capabilities, attack scenarios, and security assumptions [19] \cite{adnan2021towards}.
1.2.1 Attacker Capabilities
C1 - Data Plane Compromise: Attackers can compromise up to n-f vehicular nodes and RSUs where n is the total number of nodes. Compromised nodes can participate in routing and reputation voting while executing malicious behaviors such as false accusations or packet manipulation.
C2 - Control Plane Compromise: Adversaries may compromise up to nc-1 SDN controllers out of nc total controllers (e.g., 3 out of 4). The blockchain ordering service tolerates up to ⌊(no-1)/3⌋ Byzantine faults through BFT-SMaRt consensus, with additional resilience provided by the Controller Trust Evaluation Smart Contract [5] \cite{yahiatene2018blockchain}.
C3 - Wireless Communication Attacks: Attackers can intercept, modify, replay, or flood V2V and V2I wireless transmissions over IEEE 802.11p DSRC channels.
C4 - Computational Bounds: Adversaries are computationally powerful but bounded by classical computing. Post-quantum cryptography (FALCON-1024, Kyber-1024) protects against future quantum threats, while frequent key rotation mitigates classical cryptanalysis [6] \cite{bensasson2018scalable}.
1.2.2 Attack Scenarios
Scenario 1 - Single-Accuser Fabrication: A privileged malicious node with high reputation fabricates false evidence against honest vehicles, leveraging trusted status to cause blacklisting.
Scenario 2 - Sybil-Amplified Flooding: Multiple fake identities coordinate to flood the reputation system with false accusations, creating artificial consensus.
Scenario 3 - Timing-Based Accusations: Attackers exploit legitimate network stress events (congestion, handovers) to mask malicious accusations as genuine failures.
Scenario 4 - Evidence-Spoofing: Adversaries fabricate tampered packet logs, forged routing traces, or manipulated sensor data to frame honest nodes.
1.3 System Assumptions
The framework operates under the following security and infrastructure assumptions:
    • A1 - Cryptographic Security: All cryptographic primitives (FALCON-1024, Kyber-1024, RSA-2048, ECDH-256, AES-256, HMAC-SHA-256) are secure against known attacks when correctly implemented [6] \cite{bensasson2018scalable}.
    • A2 - Byzantine Fault Tolerance: BFT-SMaRt consensus tolerates up to ⌊(no-1)/3⌋ Byzantine faults among orderers, maintaining safety and liveness [20] \cite{castro1999practical}
    • A3 - Bootstrap Trust: At least one trusted controller exists during initial deployment for credential distribution and blockchain initialization.
    • A4 - Physical Layer Availability: Underlying communication infrastructure (IEEE 802.11p, cellular backhaul) provides sufficient availability for safety-critical applications.
    • A5 - Time Synchronization: All entities maintain loosely synchronized clocks (±1 second) via GPS or NTP for timestamp-based replay detection.
    • A6 - Computational Resources: Vehicles and RSUs possess sufficient processing power (multi-core CPUs, HSMs) for cryptographic operations and ML inference.
    • A7 - Registration Authority: A trusted registration authority (manufacturer, operator, or government agency) issues initial credentials tied to physical vehicle identities.
    • A8 - Honest Majority: The majority of network participants are honest, with high-trust endorsers predominantly following protocol specifications.
1.4 Blockchain-Based Decentralized Trust Management
The core of our approach utilizes blockchain technology to eliminate single points of failure inherent in centralized SDN architectures [4] \cite{sharma2017distblocknet}. A permissioned blockchain serves as a distributed ledger that records all network events, routing decisions, and reputation changes immutably. This prevents attackers from erasing evidence of malicious behavior or manipulating historical records. The blockchain operates across multiple SDN controllers, forming a consortium where critical decisions require consensus among trusted nodes [5] \cite{yahiatene2018blockchain}.
Three specialized smart contracts govern different security aspects. The Registration and Authentication Smart Contract manage node identity verification using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, allowing vehicles to prove their authenticity without revealing sensitive information such as vehicle identification numbers or driver identities [6] \cite{bensasson2018scalable}. This privacy-preserving mechanism prevents attackers from tracking specific vehicles while ensuring only registered nodes participate in the network.
The Reputation Management Smart Contract implements weighted endorser trust scoring to prevent false accusations from influencing blacklist decisions [7] \cite{alshaibani2023blockchain}. When a node accuses another of malicious behavior, the accusation undergoes multi-endorser validation where each endorser's vote is weighted by their historical accuracy. New nodes and previously malicious nodes carry minimal weight, preventing Sybil attackers from immediately impacting reputation scores. Reputation changes require consensus from multiple high-trust endorsers, typically requiring agreement from at least two-thirds of weighted trust scores [8] \cite{bessani2014state}.
The Controller Trust Evaluation Smart Contract addresses the critical threat of controller compromise through continuous behavioral monitoring [2] \cite{khan2017topology}. Random subsets of nodes validate whether the controller's reported network topology matches actual packet flows. Discrepancies trigger trust score reductions, and if controller trust falls below a threshold, the system automatically switches to a pre-designated backup controller, ensuring network continuity even under insider attacks [9] \cite{raja2020energy}.
1.5 AI-Driven Anomaly Detection
While blockchain provides immutability and consensus, artificial intelligence adds intelligent pattern recognition to detect coordinated attacks that might evade rule-based systems. The vehicular network is modeled as a temporal graph where vehicles and roadside units form nodes, and communication links form edges [10] \cite{zhou2020automating}. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) analyze this dynamic topology to identify anomalous patterns indicative of coordinated attacks.
Specifically, the GNN detects Sybil attack clusters by identifying groups of nodes with suspiciously similar behavioral patterns, identical registration timestamps, or star-topology accusation patterns where multiple accusers simultaneously target a single victim [11] \cite{balaram2023highly}. Temporal attention mechanisms track how reputation scores change over time, flagging sudden drops that correlate with accusation floods. Recent research demonstrates that heterogeneous graph attention networks achieve over 99% accuracy in identifying Sybil nodes in vehicular networks [12] \cite{chen2025sybil}.
Large Language Models (LLM) complement the GNN by processing unstructured data sources such as controller logs, error messages, and system alerts [13] \cite{zhang2024large}. The LLM performs semantic reasoning to understand causal relationships between events, for example, recognizing that a controller failover occurring minutes before a reputation spike suggests a timing-based attack. The LLM generates human-readable incident reports that explain detected attacks, identify suspected malicious nodes, assess confidence levels, and recommend mitigation actions. This interpretability is crucial for network administrators who must make final decisions on high-stakes actions like controller failover.
1.6 Cryptographic Defense Mechanisms
Cryptographic protocols form the foundation of attack prevention. Digital signatures ensure that every packet and accusation can be attributed to a specific authenticated node, preventing evidence fabrication [14] \cite{pournaghi2020necppa}. Post-quantum cryptography algorithms protect against future quantum computing threats, particularly important for long-term infrastructure like vehicular networks. Time-stamped authentication tokens with limited validity windows prevent replay attacks where adversaries re-transmit old legitimate packets to disrupt routing [15] \cite{benjaballah2021security}.
Location verification smart contracts validate that nodes claiming specific geographic positions are present there, preventing wormhole attacks where distant colluding nodes pretend to be neighbors [16] \cite{quevedo2020intelligent}. Cross-validation with multiple roadside units ensures location claims are accurate, and kinematic constraints (maximum velocity and acceleration limits) detect physically impossible location changes that indicate GPS spoofing.
1.7 Integrated Defense Workflow
The complete system operates through continuous cycles. Vehicles authenticate periodically using zero-knowledge proofs, proving their legitimacy without revealing identities. During each authentication cycle, nodes exchange routing information and may submit accusations if they observe suspicious behavior. All accusations include cryptographic evidence—digital signatures, timestamps, and location proofs—which smart contracts validate before accepting.
Simultaneously, the GNN analyzes the network graph updated every few seconds, identifying clusters and patterns. When anomalies are detected, the LLM processes this alongside system logs to generate threat assessments. If both AI systems and weighted endorser consensus agree that an attack is occurring, the reputation management contract updates scores and potentially blacklists malicious nodes. Throughout this process, the controller trusts evaluation contract monitors for insider threats, ready to trigger failover if needed.
This multi-layered approach ensures that attackers must simultaneously defeat multiple independent security mechanisms—cryptographic verification, blockchain consensus, weighted trust scoring, and AI anomaly detection—making successful attacks computationally infeasible [17] \cite{huo2023trustgnn}. The framework maintains vehicular network performance requirements while providing comprehensive security against reputation manipulation attacks.
1.8 Attack-Specific Mitigation Strategies
The proposed methodology addresses each false accusation attack variant through targeted defense mechanisms:
1.8.1 Single-Accuser Opportunistic Fabrication
This attack occurs when a single privileged malicious node fabricates convincing evidence against legitimate vehicles. The weighted endorser trust mechanism in the Reputation Management Smart Contract prevents this by requiring accusations to be validated by multiple high-trust endorsers [7] \cite{alshaibani2023blockchain}. A single accuser, regardless of how convincing their evidence appears, contributes only their weighted trust score to the reputation change calculation. Since blacklisting requires ≥2/3 weighted consensus, a lone attacker cannot unilaterally blacklist a victim unless multiple independent high-trust nodes corroborate the accusation.
Additionally, cryptographic evidence validation ensures that accusations lacking proper digital signatures, valid timestamps, or verifiable location proofs are automatically rejected. The blockchain's immutable audit logs all accusations with timestamps, allowing forensic analysis to identify nodes that frequently make false accusations, gradually reducing their trust weights to near-zero [8] \cite{bessani2014state}.
1.8.2 Sybil-Amplified Consensus Flooding
Sybil attacks create multiple fake identities to flood the network with coordinated accusations, attempting to achieve artificial consensus. The methodology employs three defensive layers. First, the Registration Smart Contract with Zero-Knowledge Proofs ensures that each node possesses unique cryptographic credentials tied to physical vehicle identities [6] \cite{bensasson2018scalable}. Creating Sybil identities requires either stealing legitimate credentials or registering through out-of-band channels, both of which are computationally expensive and detectable.
Second, new nodes start with minimal trust weights. Even if an attacker successfully registers multiple Sybil identities, they initially carry near-zero influence in reputation decisions. Trust accumulates gradually only through consistent honest behavior over extended periods, making instant consensus flooding ineffective [11] \cite{balaram2023highly}.
Third, the Graph Neural Network detects coordinated attack patterns by analyzing the network topology [12] \cite{chen2025sybil}. When multiple low-trust nodes simultaneously target a single victim, the GNN identifies this star-topology accusation pattern as anomalous. Features such as identical registration timestamps, similar behavioral patterns, and temporal clustering of accusations trigger high-confidence Sybil detection, prompting immediate investigation and potential preemptive blacklisting of the attacker cluster.
1.8.3 Timing-Based Accusations During High-Noise Periods
Sophisticated attackers exploit periods of legitimate network stress—congestion, controller handovers, or channel degradation—to mask malicious accusations as genuine failures. The temporal attention mechanism in the GNN specifically addresses this by analyzing accusation timing relative to network conditions [10] \cite{zhou2020automating}. The system maintains historical baselines of legitimate packet loss rates during various network states (normal operation, moderate congestion, severe congestion, handover periods).
When accusations occur during high-noise periods, the LLM performs semantic reasoning to distinguish between expected failures and coordinated attacks [13] \cite{zhang2024large}. For instance, if multiple vehicles near a congestion zone report packet loss, this correlates with legitimate network stress. However, if accusations target only specific nodes while other nearby vehicles report normal performance, this discrepancy flags a timing-based attack.
Furthermore, the weighted endorser mechanism inherently provides resilience: during genuine high-noise periods, multiple independent high-trust endorsers will naturally corroborate packet loss reports. Malicious timing-based accusations lack this broad corroboration pattern, revealing them as outliers despite the noisy environment.
1.8.4 Evidence-Spoofing with Tampered Logs / Collusion
The most sophisticated attack involves fabricating cryptographically convincing but falsified evidence—tampered packet logs, forged signatures, or collusion among multiple compromised nodes. The methodology employs multi-layer cryptographic validation as the primary defense [14] \cite{pournaghi2020necppa}. Every accusation must include: (1) valid digital signatures from authenticated nodes, (2) unfalsifiable timestamps within acceptable time windows, (3) Zero-Knowledge Proofs demonstrating the accuser's legitimate network presence, and (4) location proofs validated by multiple independent roadside units [16] \cite{quevedo2020intelligent}.
The blockchain's immutable chain-of-custody provides additional protection. Evidence must include traceable hashes of original packets stored on the blockchain at capture time. Retrospective evidence fabrication is impossible because the blockchain timestamp proves when data was recorded. Attackers cannot backdate evidence to match historical events [4] \cite{sharma2017distblocknet}.
When facing collusion among multiple compromised nodes, the Controller Trust Evaluation Smart Contract becomes critical [9] \cite{raja2020energy}. If multiple nodes collude to provide fabricated corroborating evidence, but their reports conflict with the controller's observed packet flows, the cross-endorsement validation mechanism detects this discrepancy. The system then treats the entire colluding group as suspect. Moreover, post-quantum cryptography ensures that even computationally powerful adversaries cannot forge signatures or break encryption to manufacture fake evidence [6] \cite{bensasson2018scalable}.
In scenarios where the SDN controller itself is compromised and colluding with malicious nodes, the Controller Trust Evaluation Smart Contract continuously monitors controller behavior through random cross-endorsement validation [2] \cite{khan2017topology}. If the controller manipulates reputation scores or routing tables to favor colluding attackers, its trust score decreases. Once trust falls below threshold, the blockchain automatically triggers failover to a pre-designated backup controller from a different administrative domain, neutralizing the insider threat.

1.9 Validation Approach
The proposed framework will be validated through simulation-based evaluation where all five false accusation attack variants are implemented at varying intensities from 0% to 100% network penetration. Performance will be measured using standard vehicular network metrics: Packet Delivery Ratio (percentage of packets successfully delivered), Packet Interception Ratio (percentage compromised by attackers), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient for attack detection accuracy [18] \cite{nayak2021tbddosa}.
Comparative analysis against existing approaches, including traditional trust-based systems, pure cryptographic methods, and basic blockchain implementations—will demonstrate the framework's superiority in maintaining network performance under attack while correctly identifying and isolating malicious nodes. Statistical significance will be assessed through repeated trials with different network topologies and mobility patterns, ensuring results are not artifacts of specific scenarios [19] \cite{adnan2021towards}.
