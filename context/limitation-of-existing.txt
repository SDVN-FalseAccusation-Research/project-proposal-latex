1.1.5 Limitations of Existing Works
Existing security and trust management solutions for SDVN suffer from several key limitations in addressing false accusation attacks. Most approaches assume simplified or isolated attack behaviors and fail to capture coordinated, adaptive, and multi-variant accusation strategies under realistic vehicular conditions \cite{lee2012efficient}. Additionally, many solutions require extensive disclosure of behavioral evidence, compromising privacy \cite{ullah2025decentralized}, while relying on centralized or mutable reputation storage that is vulnerable to tampering and single-point failures. Furthermore, traditional rule-based or statistical detection mechanisms lack the intelligence to model complex relational and temporal patterns of accusation behavior, resulting in limited robustness and scalability in dynamic SDVN environments \cite{cardona2020software}.
